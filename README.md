Corona statistics app 

This app shows the current information about the novel virus COVID-19 in all countries in an intuitive way

I implemented Lazy loading to help keep the bundle size smaller and help decrease
load time

In the AppRoutingModule I added a route component 
created a feature module with a  component to route to.

For Authentication reative forms and firebase was use for the authentication

With the dashboard i had two Api's one with a summary of the covid  stats of a country and one with the 
flags of the country so i did some mapping where when the flags name is the same as the country name i mapped it.
