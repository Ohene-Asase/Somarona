Corona statistics app 

This app shows the current corona virus stats in all counties in the world indicating:
  1. Total Recorded Cases
  2. Total Recoveries
  3. Total Deaths
  4. Total Infected
 
 I consumed three api's for this project :-)
  - http://api.coronastatistics.live (Corona stats api)
  - https://restcountries.eu/rest/v2 (Country data list)
  - https://ipapi.co/json/ (Ip Tracker)
